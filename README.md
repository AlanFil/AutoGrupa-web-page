# AutoGrupa-web-page
It is my almost-done first done commercial web page that I've created. It is avalible on page: www.autogrupa.com.pl. Source file containts buch of ordinary HTML5, CSS3, PHP, a little of JavaScript and some more interesting like adjusting visual content to mobile. It goes like this:

index.php - 
That file is a starting view where you can find code adjusting content to mobile. The rest isn't anything special

samochody.php - 
Here you can find a battlefield of my trials of creating form that allows to (correctly!) filter cars at this page and sorting products by price (that is another form which is working separately, and still - correctly :) ). Rest is an loop in PHP allowing page to connect with database and show it's contents in previously prepared design. All of the cars have a "SZCZEGÓŁY" button that is directing to details of a particular car. I find it nice and simple.

car.php - 
Here are just informations aggregated in database and displayed in a nice layout.

kontakt.php - 
Here you can find a form that sends an email to workers of this brand (written out at the left of this page). Some more interesting content is in "send_mail.php".

jak_to_dziala.php, o_nas.php - 
Here is nothing of interest - just some text and pictures displayed.

connect.php - 
Contains data that allows to connect to database.

admin-work.php, delcar.php, newcar.php, slog.php, zaloguj.php, logout.php - 
Those files contains code that allows non-informatician admin to add or delete cars from page. You can guess content of it by filenames. It collects most of PHP code.

style.css - 
Almost all CSS code of all visual content.
